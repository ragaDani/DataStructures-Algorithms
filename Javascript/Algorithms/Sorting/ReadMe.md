# Sorting

The folder contains the following sorting algorithms.

*   Elementary Sorting Algorithms:
    *   Bubble Sort: A sorting method where the contemporary largest number bubbles to the end of the array. Complexity; O($n^2$).
    *   Selection Sort: An algorithm which selects the minimum in the array and posts it to the beginning of the list. Complexity; O($n^2$).
    *   Insertion Sort: An algorithm which picks an element which satisfies ascending/descending conditions and inserts into the appropriate spot as the element tracker scans the list. Complexity; O($n^2$)
*   Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithms:
    *   Merge Sort:
    *   Quick Sort:
